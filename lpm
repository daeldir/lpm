    LPM (Literate Programming  Markup)  is  a  set  of two products.
    First, it is a  (lightweight  markup language)[..], suitable for
    literate programming redaction. It  is  also  a software able to
    read files written in  this  language,  and  to extract code and
    documentation from it,  while  reformatting  the  source file to
    make it more readable.

    The creation of this program  as  been  motivated by the wish to
    write literate  softwares  in  a  simple  and  lightweight  way,
    which is not the case  with  « heavy »  markup languages such as
    LaTeX  and  HTML.  The  choice   of  a  new  lightweight  markup
    language, instead of using  one  of  the  many already existing,
    is due to the fact that  none  of  these languages enabled us to
    include source code in  the  document  **in  a simple fashion**.
    Literate programming requiring the  inclusion  of  a lot of code
    in the documentation, it is  not  pleasant  to  have, in most of
    the languages, to indent the code block at each line. 
    
    So, that language is  able  to  detect  code  block with opening
    and  closing  tags,  instead  of  relying  on  indentation.  Our
    language is also aimed  at  the  redaction of big documentation,
    which is not the case of  a  lot of lightweight markup languages
    (in general thought  with  small  texts  in  mind,  like wiki or
    blogs   articles).   Please   note    that    in   that   field,
    ReStructuredText[..]   seems   to    be    tailored    for   big
    documentation, but does not meet  our  requirement for easy code
    inclusion. The  language  have  also  some  literate programming
    specific commands, that  we  could  not  have  found  in  a more
    “general” lightweight markup language.

    La dernière fonctionnalité  de  notre  logiciel  est de proposer
    un reformatage du code source  du  document.  En effet, si, pour
    un premier contact,  nous  lisons  la  documentation générée par
    le logiciel, nous  finissons  invariablement  par travailler sur
    la source de ce document  pour  le  modifier. Il peut alors être
    agréable et bénéfique que cette  source  soit bien présentée, ce
    que permet notre logiciel.
