== Booleans!

They are not defined in the C89  standard.*  Booleans do not exist in C,
but we define them anyway for their semantic value. 

<Code: lpm structures and types
#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE !TRUE

typedef char bool;

 *: I don't know where they  are  defined,  but  we sometime have a nice
    <<text>bool.h> header to work with.
